	\begin{itemize}
		\item<1-> A consistent estimate of the closed loop transfer function of the turbine and electromechanical dynamics can be obtained by using:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item<2-> Measured PMU frequency as the output $u[n]$
				\item<3-> Measured PMU power as the input $y[n]$
			\end{itemize}
		\item<4-> The proof was done with the following assumptions.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item The system is excited by a load acting as a filtered white noise process
				\item The measurement error of the electrical power is negligible.
				\item The measured frequency is a good estimate of the generator speed.
			\end{itemize}
