				\item<1-> A transfer function was identified from the electrical frequency to the electrical power under normal operation using the ARX model structure.
				\item<2-> A transfer function was identified from the electrical frequency to the electrical power under normal operation using vector fitting.
				\item<3-> There are also papers in the literature using other methods for online identification, however, mostly relying on data from disturbance recordings.
