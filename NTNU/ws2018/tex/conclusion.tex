\section{Conclusions and further work}
\begin{frame}{\secname}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Conclusions:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item It is indeed possible to identify the turbine dynamics(closed loop with electromechanical dynamics) using PMU measurements.
			\item However, only low the low frequency dynamics
		\end{itemize}
		\item Future work:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Look into how to best do the identification of turbine dynamics.
			\item Look into control solutions using identified models.
		\end{itemize}
