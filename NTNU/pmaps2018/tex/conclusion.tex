	\begin{itemize}
		\item It is indeed possible to identify the turbine dynamics(closed loop with electromechanical dynamics) using PMU measurements.
		\item The results from real life measurements seem reasonable and have low variance, however, they should be further validated.
		\item The assumptions should be further investigated
	\end{itemize}
