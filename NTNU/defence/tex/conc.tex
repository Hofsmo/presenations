	\frametitle{Conclusions}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The requirements can be checked using PMU-measurements, however, the results will be biased for faster dynamics, since we are measuring the frequency instead of the rotational speed of the machine.
		\item The requirements can be checked using control system measurements in normal operation, however, the results may be biased for faster dynamics, because of the delay condition.
		\item The requirements can be checked using measurement from normal operation with extra excitation. The added excitation will help on potential bias.
