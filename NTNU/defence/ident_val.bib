	doi = {10.1109/NAPS.2015.7335089},
	abstract = {Frequency Response has been the focus of increased attention and analysis recently due to its importance to the reliability of the network. The models used by the utilities proved to be insufficient and the inability to duplicate events using the existing models and databases has led to several initiatives to address these shortfalls. In this work, the effect of the dead-band in the governor/turbine model is investigated. For this purpose, {IEEEG}1 model is used to study the frequency response of the steam generators. Many of the existing industrial software used by the utilities ignore the dead-band function in their governor model. Using the incorrect parameters for the dead-band function can lead to the significantly incorrect frequency response, it is even worth in case of ignoring the dead-band function. In this paper, the effect of the dead-band setting on the frequency response is studied. The response of the generator during the frequency deviation is analyzed both with and without the dead-band. {ETAP} is used as a good candidate for an industrial software to study the effect of the frequency deviation on the generator response. Ignoring the dead-band is shown to depict a very optimistic picture of the frequency response.},

The outputs of the estimation model and the outputs from the {PMU} measurements are compared.

It is found that frequency response tests with sinusoidal input signals give more reliable information about the dynamics of the plants than step response tests.

This paper gives the detailed derivation of converting a generator model with primary frequency control into an {ARX} model.

In the digital repository being made available with the submission of this paper ({SmarTSLab}\_Nordic44 Repository at Github, 2016) [2], a total of 8760 snapshots (for the year 2015) that can be used to initialize and execute dynamic simulations using tools compatible with {CIM} v14, the Modelica language and the proprietary {PSS}/E tool are provided. The Python scripts to generate the snapshots (processed data) are also available with all the data in the {GitHub} repository ({SmarTSLab}\_Nordic44 Repository at Github, 2016) [2].
This Nordic 44 equivalent model was also used in {iTesla} project ({iTesla}) [3] to carry out simulations within a dynamic security assessment toolset ({iTesla}, 2016) [4], and has been further enhanced during the {ITEA}3 {OpenCPS} project ({iTEA}3) [5]. The raw, processed data and output models utilized within the {iTesla} platform ({iTesla}, 2016) [4] are also available in the repository.

The hypotheses and assumptions to define bus frequencies are duly discussed. The rationale behind the proposed frequency divider is first illustrated through a simple 3-bus system. Then the general formulation is duly presented and tested on two real-world networks, namely a 1,479-bus model of the all-island Irish system and a 21,177-bus model of the European transmission system.},

The modified title Power System Dynamics: Stability and Control reflects a slight shift in focus from solely describing power system dynamics to the means of dealing with them. The book has been expanded by about a third to include: a new chapter on wind power generation; a new section on wide-area measurement systems ({WAMS}) and their application for real-time control; an overview of lessons learned from wide-spread blackouts affecting North America and Europe in 2003, 2004 and 2006; enhanced treatment of voltage stability and control, and frequency stability and control; application of Lyapunov direct method to analyse and enhance stability of multi-machine power systems ; expanded coverage of steady-state stability using eigenvalue analysis, including modal analysis of dynamic equivalents. The book continues the successful approach of the first edition by progressing from simplicity to complexity. It places the emphasis first on understanding the underlying physical principles before proceeding to more complex models and algorithms. The reader will appreciate the authors'accessible approach as the book is illustrated by over 400 diagrams and a large number of examples. Power System Dynamics: Stability and Control, Second Edition is an essential resource for graduates of electrical engineering. It is also a clear and comprehensive reference text for undergraduate students, and for practising engineers and researchers who are working in electricity companies or in the development of power system technologies.},

For a known interconnection structure it is shown that the classical prediction error methods for closed-loop identification can be generalized to provide consistent model estimates, under specified experimental circumstances. Two classes of methods considered in this paper are the direct method and the joint-{IO} method that rely on consistent noise models, and indirect methods that rely on external excitation signals like two-stage and {IV} methods. Graph theoretical tools are presented to verify the topological conditions under which the several methods lead to consistent module estimates.},

This paper initiates an exploration of these ideas. The paper considers linear systems with energy (or power) bounded inputs. We assume that the parameters lie in a given compact set and optimise the worst case over this set. We also provide a detailed analysis of the solution for an illustrative one parameter example and propose a convex optimisation algorithm that can be applied more generally to a discretised approximation to the design problem. We also examine the role played by different design criteria and present a simulation example illustrating the merits of the proposed approach.},

It is assumed that the transfer function models possess a certain shift-property, which is satisfied for example by all polynomial-type models. Expressions for the variances of the transfer function estimates are derived, that are asymptotic both in the number of observed data and in the model orders. The result is that the joint covariance matrix of the transfer functions from input to output and from driving white noise source to the additive output disturbance, respectively, is proportional to the inverse of the joint spectrum matrix for the input and driving noise multiplied by the spectrum of the additive output noise. The factor of proportionality is the ratio of model order to number of data. This result is independent of the particular model structure used. The result is applied to evaluate the performance degradation due to variance for a number of typical model uses. Some consequences for input design are also drawn.},

The method developed in this paper is based on a combination of the instrumental variable philosophy and closed-loop prediction error identification methods, and leads to consistent estimates of modules in a dynamic network.

It is therefore a growing concern that the frequency quality will deteriorate. One way of mitigating these problems may be a more detailed monitoring of the generators providing the primary reserves. A promising approach for monitoring the generators is to identify turbine governing system parameters using system identification. This will allow for estimating the droop and the bandwidth of the governor, parameters that are important for the primary control. Furthermore, if this can be reliably done on ambient data, updated estimates of these parameters can be obtained relatively fast. In this paper we will look into how vector fitting can be used for this purpose. The algorithm possesses some interesting properties for automatically constructing models from ambient data. How this can be done will be presented together with results obtained using real data from the Norwegian power system. A simple criterion for reducing the obtained model order is also proposed.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes an algorithm for determining a minimum generation redispatch capable of moving specific oscillation modes to the closest small-signal security boundary that guarantees them a desired damping factor. The algorithm combines nonlinear optimization techniques with numerical eigenvalue sensitivities obtained from multiple runs of a load flow solver and partial eigensolutions. The algorithm, namely Closest Security Boundary for Generation Redispatch using Eigenvalue Sensitivities ({CSBGRES}) relies on sparse matrices and is applicable to large-scale power systems. The work presents results on the Brazilian Interconnected Power System ({BIPS}) and the Nordic 44 Test System (N44S).},

The toolbox was designed to carry out parameter identification on models developed using the Modelica language, focusing in particular on power system model identification needs. The toolbox has been developed with modularity and extensibility in mind, using Matlab/Simulink as a plug-in environment, where different tasks of the identification process are carried out. The identification process uses different optimization algorithms to improve the fitting of the model’s response to selected criteria. The modular architecture of {RaPId} gives users complete freedom to extend and adapt the software to their needs, e.g. to implement or link external solvers for simulation or optimization. The compatibility with Modelica models is brought by the use of technologies compliant with the Functional Mock-up Interface ({FMI}) standard.},

Among this research have been papers on identification of turbine and turbine governor dynamics from {PMU} measurements. However, no attempt at a theoretical validation has been made. This paper fills in this gap by a theoretical validation using a {DC} power flow model for modelling the power flows in the grids. By doing this it is shown that it is indeed possible to identify the closed loop transfer function of the turbine, turbine governor and electromechanical dynamics. An experimental validation using results from a real life power system is also presented.},

Many different identification approaches were developed over the years to estimate the parameters of a wide range of block-oriented nonlinear models. One class of these approaches uses linear approximations to initialize the identification algorithm. The best linear approximation framework and the ϵ-approximation framework, or equivalent frameworks, allow the user to extract important information about the system, guide the user in selecting good candidate model structures and orders, and prove to be a good starting point for nonlinear system identification algorithms. This paper gives an overview of the different block-oriented nonlinear models that can be identified using linear approximations, and of the identification algorithms that have been developed in the past. A non-exhaustive overview of the most important other block-oriented nonlinear system identification approaches is also provided throughout this paper.},
