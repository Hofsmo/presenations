	abstract = {Transmission corridors between interconnected power systems or within countrywide transmission systems are limiting network performance or even market activities. We describe a state-of-the-art wide-area measurement system which is commercially available, and a new method to assess the voltage stability of a transmission corridor. Using only topological information, several lines can be grouped into a so-called virtual transmission corridor, whose parameters can be calculated from wide-area measurements. A simple computational procedure for stability analysis makes it possible to provide approximate stability margins with an update rate of less than a second. Such stability margins can be the basis for on-line dynamic rating of lines. Business cases for such dynamic rating are also discussed.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a concept, method, and implementation of utilizing phasor measurement unit ({PMU}) information to monitor the wide-area security of a power system. The close dependency of major transmission paths requires an approach that takes that interaction into account while establishing operational transfer capability, and evaluates grid reliability and security on a system-wide basis. Thus, the concept of wide-area security region, which considers all essential constraints, including thermal, voltage stability, transient stability, and small signal stability, is proposed. This approach expands the idea of traditional transmission system nomograms to a multidimensional case, involving multiple system limits and parameters such as transmission path constraints, zonal generation or load, etc., considered concurrently. In this paper, the security region boundary is represented using piecewise approximation with the help of linear inequalities (so called hyperplanes) in a multidimensional space, consisting of system parameters that are critical for security analysis. The goal of this approximation is to find a minimum set of hyperplanes that describe the boundary with a given accuracy. Offline computer simulations are conducted to build the security region and the hyperplanes can be applied in real time with phasor information for on-line security assessment. Numerical simulations have been performed for the full size Western Electricity Coordinating Council ({WECC}) system model, which comprises 15 126 buses and 3034 generators. Simulation results demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach, and proved that the proposed approach can significantly enhance the wide-area situation awareness for a bulk power system like {WECC}.},

The approach solely requires information from {PMUs} installed at concerned load buses at substations in addition to available information of system topology and load power obtained from {SCADA}/{EMS} or state estimator. The proposed algorithm estimates the Thevenin impedance seen at the load bus and consequently the maximum loadability. This power transfer limit is used as an indicator for voltage stability assessment when compared to the load power. It is emphasized that only topology of the considered subsystem is needed, not the whole network. This feature makes the method viable for online implementation since the computation requirement is insignificant. In principle, the proposed methodology is not limited to specific grids in terms of voltage level, but it is especially suitable for sub-transmission networks, where loads are supplied by bulk power source and voltage instability is imposed by long transmission lines. The proposed approach is validated by simulations on the Norwegian transmission grid.},

One such approach is feedback modulation of the Pacific {DC} Intertie ({PDCI}). This paper summarizes simulation results from a study to evaluate {PDCI} damping control in the {wNAPS}.

Challenges in system modeling are described, and main results from linear analyses are presented and compared with nonlinear dynamic simulations. The results are seen to correspond well with real system observations. Modal analysis and nonlinear simulations are applied to verify design of power system stabilizers of some important generators in Finland. Similar methods are also used for retuning and verification of stabilizers on the Fennoskan {HVDC} link between Sweden and Finland. The stabilizer performance is demonstrated in terms of stability improvements. A main conclusion is that linear techniques can be of great benefit when designing damping controllers for large power systems. It is also illustrated, with the use of validated models, how linear tools can be used in operation planning for determination of power transfer limits.},

	abstract = {This article reports the results from the implementation and testing of a Wide-Area Power Oscillation Damper ({WAPOD}) controlling a 180 Mvar {TCR} Static Var Compensator ({SVC}) installed in the Hasle substation of Norwegian 420 {kV} transmission grid. The {WAPOD} uses voltage phase angle signals from two distant locations in the Norwegian grid as inputs to the damping controller. The damping controller modulates the voltage reference set point used by the {SVC}'s voltage controller, thereby creating a damping effect. The {WAPOD} is an extension to the existing Power Oscillation Damping ({POD}) controller that uses local measurements. A switch-over logic allows for the use of no damping control, local damping control or wide-area control. Field tests were performed during November 2011, and involved the disconnection and re-connection of a 420 {kV} transmission line. The performance of the {WAPOD} is compared to that of state-of-the-art local Phasor {POD}, and when no damping control is enabled. The testing results show that the {WAPOD} performed satisfactorily and according to the design expectations. These results show that the potential flexibility of the {WAPOD} to choose, among the different {PMU} signals, those that have the good observability of inter-area modes can be an advantage to the use of local feedback signals for damping control, as it is current practice today. Further testing of this {WAPOD} with other {PMU} signals from locations with stronger observability will be helpful to illustrate the advantage of this flexibility.},

Following a thorough singular value and eigenvalue analysis of the system dynamic interactions, five control sites consisting of four generators and one synchronous condenser are chosen to implement new power system stabilizers with a supplementary input from remote phasor measuring units, geographically spread over nine electrically coherent areas. Since the remote feedback loops are built on top of an existing decentralized control system, this design approach results in a decentralized/hierarchical control architecture with significant advantages in terms of reliability and operational flexibility. A systematic control and measurement pairing yielded four dominant natural loops, each associated with a significant open-loop inter-area oscillatory mode at 0.06, 0.4, 0.7 and 0.95 Hz respectively. These {PSSs} have a speed sensitive local loop operating in the usual way, and a wide-area measurement based global loop which involves a single differential frequency signal between two suitably selected areas. The tuning and coordination technique for these advanced multiple input signals {PSSs} is described. Their impacts on the system is assessed using both small-signal analysis and nonlinear simulations in a transient stability program.

	abstract = {{PMU} placement is important to achieve full system observability. Traditional {PMU} placement algorithms only work for systems in normal condition. During power system restoration, system topology and condition change in each step. Synchrophsors can help to improve the reliability and efficiency of restoration strategy. However, the original {PMU} placement cannot guarantee system observability in each restoration step. In this paper, a new optimal {PMU} placement is formulated for single and multiple islands restoration. With the aid of {PMU}, system operator can obtain real-time measurements of voltage (magnitude and angle) and frequency from different islands and perform the parallel restoration precisely. The proposed algorithm is tested in modified {IEEE} 14-bus system. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed model and the advantage of {PMU}-aided parallel restoration.},

Even though such events are rare, preparedness for them is critical because extended power outages endanger human lives, compromise national security, or result in economic losses of billions of dollars. Since most of the generating units cannot restart without connecting to an energized grid, the system operator relies on a few units with the ability to start autonomously, called Black Start ({BS}) units, to restore the power system. Allocating and maintaining these units is costly and can severely impact the restoration security and time. We formulate an optimization problem to optimally allocate {BS} units in the grid, while simultaneously optimizing over the restoration sequence. We extend existing optimal allocation models by including grid considerations such as active power nodal balance, transmission switching, nodal reactive power support and voltage limits. In order to aid the branch and bound tree that solves the resulting large scale mixed integer program, we propose a randomized heuristic that is executed multiple times in parallel on a high-performance computing environment to find feasible solutions. We proceed to solve the {IEEE}-39, the {IEEE}-118, and a simplified {WECC} system with 225 nodes and 136 generators to near optimality.},

The ability to restore power services quickly after a blackout is crucial for power system resilience. Power system restoration is an extremely complicated process, involving multiple steps, highly combinatorial operational decisions, and highly nonlinear technical constraints, which make restoration planning an exceptionally challenging task. This paper will first introduce the restoration process and operations, examine important issues in restoration, and survey the state of the art in the research and practice of power system restoration planning. Then, we will focus on the commonly used buildup restoration planning strategy, in which the system is sectionalized into smaller subsystems with initial power sources, and then the subsystems are restored in parallel. Due to the complexity, existing approaches treat the sectionalization and restoration separately, leading to a suboptimal restoration plan. We will introduce an integrated restoration planning approach to improve the quality of restoration plans globally (such as shorter overall restoration time) by using mathematical programming and simulation in an interactive and iterative way. Case studies will be provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

A lot of research work has been done on different aspects of the whole power system restoration procedure. However, more time will be required to complete the power system restoration process in an actual situation if accurate and real-time system data cannot be obtained. With the development of the wide area monitoring system ({WAMS}), power system operators are capable of accessing to more accurate data in the restoration stage after a major outage. The ultimate goal of the system restoration is to restore as much load as possible while in the shortest period of time after a blackout, and the restorable load can be estimated by employing {WAMS}. Moreover, discrete restorable loads are employed considering the limited number of circuit-breaker operations and the practical topology of distribution systems. In this work, a restorable load estimation method is proposed employing {WAMS} data after the network frame has been reenergized, and {WAMS} is also employed to monitor the system parameters in case the newly recovered system becomes unstable again. The proposed method has been validated with the New England 39-Bus system and an actual power system in Guangzhou, China.},

It is of great significance to maintain its stability, especially in the current development scenario of large-scale interconnected power systems. Thermostatically controlled appliances ({TCAs}) are good controllable resources for demand response owing to their rapid response capabilities and relatively wide controllable ranges. In this study, domestic water heaters, which have wider deadbands compared with other typical {TCAs}, such as heat pumps, are used as frequency regulation resources. The main contribution of this paper is that it proposes a queuing-controlled strategy with lock-on and off constraints for controlling an efficient power plant consisting of water heaters ({EPP}-{WH}). The queuing-controlled strategy enables {TCAs} to provide frequency regulation ancillary service for the normal operation of the power system. The thermal dynamic process of the water heater and the formation of the {EPP}-{WH} are first discussed. Based on the developed model, a series of strategies are proposed, including load shedding calculation, top layer optimization, and improved temperature priority list ({TPL}) strategy with lock-on and off constraints. Finally, typical case studies are discussed to illustrate the frequency regulation effects and the effects of two characteristic parametersâusersâ willingness and lock time limits. Reasonable targets are generated based on various consideration from top layer optimization module. The results indicate that using the model and proposed strategies, the {EPP}-{WH} has good frequency regulation performance.},

The {SFR} model is a simplification of other models used for this purpose, but it is believed to include the essential system dynamics. The {SFR} model is based on neglecting nonlinearities and all but the largest time constants in the equations of the generating units of the power system, with the added assumption that the generation is dominated by reheat steam turbine generators. This means that the generating unit inertia and reheat time constants predominate over the system average frequency response. Moreover, since only two time constants predominate, the resulting system response can be computed in closed form, thereby providing a simple, but fairly accurate, method of estimating the essential characteristics of the system frequency response.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

	doi = {10.1109/TDC.2018.8440257},
	abstract = {Inter-area oscillations have severely limited maximum power transfer among different areas in large-scale interconnected power grid. If not quickly damped as soon as possible, they may cause system breakup and even lead to large cascading blackouts. To increase the damping of inter-area oscillations, both power system stabilizer ({PSS}) and flexible {AC} transmission system ({FACTS}) controller have been widely considered, which affect the real power flow indirectly. However, the effectiveness of these controllers is restricted to the neighborhood of a prescribed set of operating conditions. In this paper, wide-area demand-side control is developed to directly modulate the real power of end-user loads for oscillation mitigation. The proposed control strategy is implemented in a hierarchical manner. At the device layer, individual end-user loads independently turn {ON} or {OFF} in response to the broadcasted signals from the coordinator during the real time. At the supervisory layer, autonomous responses of end-user loads are coordinated to ensure the desired power modulation. The effectiveness of the proposed wide-area demand-side control in improving small-signal stability is illustrated by simulations on a large-scale test system.},

This paper proposes a novel predictive method for emergency frequency control to be used on such occasions. The proposed method avoids the drawbacks of local underfrequency load shedding schemes, such as delayed response and overshedding, by basing control on synchronized phasor measurements. A single machine equivalent for each power system island including the frequency sensitivity of loads, is computed online using phasor measurements. Using this model the progression of frequency stability after a contingency is predicted and stabilizing load shedding is determined in a co-ordinated way for the supervised area of the power system.},
