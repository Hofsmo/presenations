				\item<1-> There are concerns about the frequency quality in the Nordic countries
				\item<2-> To prevent large deviations in frequency generators participate in frequency containment control (FCR)
				\item<3-> FCR is sometimes referred to as primary control
				\item<4-> Generators of a certain size have to contribute to this control
				\item<5-> It is of interest to monitor the generators' FCR performance with respect to both gain and bandwidth
