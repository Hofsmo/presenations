	abstract = {This paper addresses the construction of lumped macromodels for package structures. A technique named Time-Domain Vector Fitting ({TD}-{VF}) is introduced for the identification of the dominant poles of the structure. This method uses as raw data transient excitations and responses at the ports of the structure. These responses are easily obtained from transient full-wave electromagnetic solvers based, e.g., on Finite Differences. The rational approximation can be easily synthesized into a {SPICE}-compatible subcircuit providing a broadband approximation to the input-output behavior of the package.},

	abstract = {This paper compares alternative methods for linear modeling of simulated time-domain responses by a rational approximation. The traditional approach based on autoregressive moving average ({ARMA}) is compared with two alternative approaches that have been introduced in recent years: Z-Domain Vector Fitting ({ZD}-{VF}) and Time-Domain Vector Fitting ({TD}-{VF}). Following a description of their implementation and fundamental properties, the methods are applied to the modeling of a frequency-dependent network equivalent. It is shown that {TD}-{VF} offers superior results in terms of accuracy and robustness, and the model has guaranteed stable poles. The {ARMA} approach requires higher orders than the others and the resulting model can be unstable. The {ZD}-{VF} approach is robust and gives a model with stable poles, but it produces incorrect simulation results when applied to truncated time-domain responses. The inaccuracy is caused mainly by the conversion of time-domain data into the z-domain. The fitting process of {ARMA} is faster than with the other approaches since it does not involve iterative pole relocations.},

In this paper we show that the {TD}-{VF} yields more accurate results than {ZD}-{VF}, mainly because of its ability to handle truncated responses. This makes {TD}-{VF} more applicable to practical applications. In addition, we show that with {TD}-{VF} one may in certain situations greatly improve the accuracy of the extracted model by introducing the same numerical integration method in the extraction routine as the one used by the circuit simulator.},

This is achieved by replacing a set of starting poles with an improved set of poles via a scaling procedure. A previous paper (Gustavsen et al., 1997) described the application of the method to smooth functions using real starting poles. This paper extends the method to functions with a high number of resonance peaks by allowing complex starting poles. Fundamental properties of the method are discussed and details of its practical implementation are described. The method is demonstrated to be very suitable for fitting network equivalents and transformer responses. The computer code is in the public domain, available from the first author},

	abstract = {This paper presents a methodology to identify a frequency-dependent network equivalent from a highly resonant frequency response and in a broad range of frequencies. Primarily, the identification process consists on dividing the complete frequency range into a number of subranges either uniformly spaced or by containing an equal number of resonance peaks. Vector fitting ({VF}) is then applied to each subrange, yielding an accurate local approximation. A refinement of the local set of partial fractions is made through model-order reduction to remove spurious (redundant) poles. The final equivalent comprises a reduced number of poles, keeping the computational load lower than when applying {VF} to the whole range of frequencies while giving a similar rms error. An illustrative example involving a transmission system is presented for validation of the procedures above.},
