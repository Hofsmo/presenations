	abstract = {Electric power systems are nonlinear and complicate in nature. Along with increasing size of power systems, their complexity becomes more. Besides, by using additional and auxiliary components such as Flexible {AC} Transmission Systems ({FACTS}) devises, Power System Stabilizers ({PSSs}), excitation systems, turbine-governor systems and etc, the dynamic model of network is increased and power system becomes more complicate. The nonlinear dynamic model of these large power systems is easily obtained. But, the complexity makes it difficult to obtain a linear dynamic model of power system. Obtaining an appropriate linear model is necessary in order to analysis and study of power system. In tradition method, a linear dynamic model of power system is obtained by linearization of nonlinear dynamic model around an operating condition. But in large electric power systems, the linearization technique is very sophisticate and maybe impossible. Concerning this matter, in this paper a Recursive Least Square ({RLS}) technique is used to parameter identification in a multi machine electric power system. In this method a linear model is assumed for power system and its parameters are accurately computed by using {RLS} method. In order to verifying the results, the obtained linear model is compared with the nonlinear model. The simulation results show the validity of identified model, as the response of identified linear model is very near to nonlinear model. © Indian Society for Education and Environment ({iSee}).},

	abstract = {Hydraulic turbine generating unit plays an important role in power system. An accurate hydraulic turbine governor system model is essential to analyze its stability and dynamic performance. In order to identify the parameters of the hydraulic turbine governor system model, a new approach of Bacterial Foraging Optimization Algorithm ({BFOA}) is introduced in this study. To improve the precision of the identification process, a modified objective function is proposed based on the measurement of gate opening, mechanical torque and generator speed from a simulated model. The improved objective function ({IOF}) and the conventional objective function ({COF}) are used in the identification and two sets of parameters are derived and compared. The results show that {BFOA} is effective in identification of hydraulic turbine governor system and parameters derived from the modified objective function have a higher accuracy.},

	abstract = {Kalman's minimal realization theory involves geometric objects (controllable, unobservable subspaces) which are subject to structural instability. Specifically, arbitrarily small perturbations in a model may cause a change in the dimensions of the associated subspaces. This situation is manifested in computational difficulties which arise in attempts to apply textbook algorithms for computing a minimal realization. Structural instability associated with geometric theories is not unique to control; it arises in the theory of linear equations as well. In this setting, the computational problems have been studied for decades and excellent tools have been developed for coping with the situation. One of the main goals of this paper is to call attention to principal component analysis (Hotelling, 1933), and an algorithm (Golub and Reinsch, 1970) for computing the singular value decompositon of a matrix. Together they form a powerful tool for coping with structural instability in dynamic systems. As developed in this paper, principal component analysis is a technique for analyzing signals. (Singular value decomposition provides the computational machinery.) For this reason, Kalman's minimal realization theory is recast in terms of responses to injected signals. Application of the signal analysis to controllability and observability leads to a coordinate system in which the "internally balanced" model has special properties. For asymptotically stable systems, this yields working approximations of , the controllable and unobservable subspaces. It is proposed that a natural first step in model reduction is to apply the mechanics of minimal realization using these working subspaces.},

	abstract = {Speed governors are key elements in the dynamic performance of electric power systems. Therefore, accurate governor models are of great importance in simulating and investigating the power system transient phenomena. Model parameters of such devices are, however, usually unavailable or inaccurate, especially when old generators are involved. Most methods for speed governor parameter estimation are based on measurements of frequency and active power variations during transient operation. This paper proposes a genetic algorithm based optimization technique for parameter estimation, which makes use of such measurements. The proposed methodology uses a real-coded genetic algorithm. The paper estimates the parameters of all system generators simultaneously, instead of every machine independently, which is fully in line with the interest to treat the electric power system as a whole and study its comprehensive behaviour. Moreover, the methodology is not model-dependent and, therefore, it is readily applicable to a variety of model types and for many different test procedures. The proposed methodology is applied to the electric power system of Crete and the results demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of this approach.},

	abstract = {The recent increased number of black outs in the power system has been largely due to growing competition and deregulation among the power industry. Power systems are complex nonlinear systems and often exhibit low frequency electro-mechanical oscillations due to insufficient damping caused by severe operating conditions. This needs an advanced modeling and control techniques for effective control of power plants. In case of hydroelectric plant the hydro turbine is a non-linear, non-stationary multivariable system whose characteristics vary significantly with the unpredictable load on it and this presents a difficulty in designing an efficient and reliable controller. A conservatively designed control fails to perform as expected. Keeping this in mind, hydro plant control is an application area with an interesting set of problems for control engineering people. Mainly some of these problems focus towards regulation of turbine with large load variation in the power system. These problems have not been adequately solved and continue to pose challenges to the control community. In this review paper, the authors have tried to broadly categorize the research work done so far on the basis of hydro plant model development and its controller design under different sections. A substantial number of relevant research papers can be found on the plant modeling, design aspects of control methodologies and their performance study.},

	doi = {10.1109/PSCE.2006.296293},
	abstract = {Near real-time measurement-based electromechanical-mode estimation offers considerable potential for many future power-system operation and control strategies. Recent research has investigated the use of low-level pseudo random noise ({PRN}) probing signals injected into power systems to estimate the low-frequency electromechanical modes. Because of the random nature of a power system, estimating the modes from a single probing experiment is very difficult. Ideally, one would use a Monte-Carlo approach with multiple independent probing experiments resulting in a mode estimation distribution. Then, one could state that the mode is within a region of the complex plane. Unfortunately, conducting multiple probing experiments is prohibitive for most power-system applications. This paper presents a methodology for estimating the mode distribution based on one probing test using a Bootstrap algorithm. The proposed method is applied to both simulation data and actual-system measurement data to illustrate its performance and application. It is demonstrated that the method can provide valuable information to {PRN} tests and guide future {PRN} probing signal design and selection},

	abstract = {Existing mode meter algorithms were derived with the assumption that load variations are accurately represented by white noise or an integral of white noise, which may not be satisfied in actual power systems. This paper proposes a mode meter algorithm which relaxes this assumption by explicitly taking into account spectral load characteristics. These characteristics can be either measured or estimated using the inverse of the existing power system model. The method is developed assuming an autoregressive moving average ({ARMA}) model of the system and incorporating estimated correlations between loads as inputs and synchrophasor measurements as outputs. Performances of the proposed method are compared with the Yule-Walker and N4SID methods using simulated synchrophasor data obtained from the {KTH} Nordic 32 test system. Finally, the effects of measurement noise on the proposed method are analyzed, as well as the effects of model uncertainty when the power system model is used to determine spectral load characteristics. It is shown that the proposed algorithm increases accuracy in mode estimates when the loads are described with nonwhite noise.},

In a competitive environment, scheduling generation and limiting transfers to ensure the system remains stable bring cost impacts for the test. Another factor influencing the test is that the resulting oscillation must be significantly above the noise level from customer load variations. Examination of normal operation angle measurements across 1200 km in Queensland and power measurements in Victoria show that frequencies and damping of the modes can be determined.

The results of the presented method are compared with respect to the ones obtained from a Monte Carlo technique, showing its effectiveness in reducing the number of trials, which would be beneficial for online power system monitoring, as it can decrease the number of samples, thus ensuring that the system dynamics would not change significantly over the monitoring time window, and yielding more dependable results. Two test cases, namely, the two-area benchmark system and the {IEEE} 14-bus system, with different orders of the system identification model used, are utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.},

It is found that frequency response tests with sinusoidal input signals give more reliable information about the dynamics of the plants than step response tests. It is also shown that backlash in the runner and guide vane regulating mechanisms are of great importance for the dynamic behavior of the plants, and that the incremental gain from guide vane opening to power varies considerably with the operation point.},
