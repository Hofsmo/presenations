	\begin{itemize}
		\item<1-> Vector fitting obtains good fit normally in the range between $70\%$ and $90\%$.
		\item<2-> It is fast with an execution time around $0.1s$
		\item<3-> It is robust, just filter your data and choose poles in the frequency range of interest and it works.
		\item<4-> Good results were obtained with time windows as short as five minutes.
		\item<5-> One drawback is the lack of uncertainty quantification for identified parameters
